# Coursera_Capstone_Battle_of_Neighborhoods

This project is the week 5 capstone project of the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate.

What do we do in this project

In this project, we are trying to explore the similarity between neighborhoods in New York City and Philadelphia.

The stakeholders of this project would be someone living in Philadelphia who will be moving to New York City for a new job. 
This project aims to find similar neighborhoods using K-means clustering using the nearby venues as features.

To complete this task, we will do the following steps in this project:

* Collecting data: Including New York City neighborhood data, Philadelphia Neighborhood data, (names of neigborhoods and coordinates) and 
venues nearby each neighborhood which will be generated by Foursquare API.
* Exploratory data analysis to better understand our working dataset
* Creating Map of Manhattan and map of philadelphia using Folium library.
* Clustering the neighborhoods: We will use K-means clustering machine learning algorithm.  K-means clustering provides fast processing especially when we have too many variables.
* Plotting the results on maps for visualization.
